## Launch correctly using the launch files provided in the capstone repo. Please note that we will not be able to accommodate special launch instructions or run additional scripts from your submission to download files. The launch/styx.launch and launch/site.launch files will be used to test code in the simulator and on the vehicle respectively. The submission size limit for this project has been increased to 2GB.

We were able to successfully launch using launch files
